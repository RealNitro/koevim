Mostly useful for generating docstrings. Select your function definition, the
line(s) with 'def ...', and press CTRL-F7. A docstring should have been
generated. Only works for docstrings with double quotes for now. Like this:

::

    """My docstring"""

There's some other (old) stuff in there too that I no longer remember...
